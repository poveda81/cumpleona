PROMPT:
================================================================================

A vintage 1980s horror/adventure comic book panel illustration.
The art style must strictly adhere to heavy black ink outlines, bold line work, and prominent halftone dot shading (Ben-Day dots) throughout the entire image for texture and color, mimicking aged paper.

You have to use the uploaded photos of the two characters.
They will be standing together in a full-body or three-quarter view shot.

Both characters are rendered consistently in the aforementioned comic book style, maintaining their unique items if applicable (e.g., flashlights, calculators).
The clothing is styled in the 80s retro aesthetic and can be a mix of casual and adventure-ready outfits (jackets, hoodies, rolled-up jeans, retro sneakers, backpacks, etc...) always in Stranger Things style.

The scene is set in:
**The Abandoned Railway**

walking along a set of rusted, abandoned railway tracks that disappear into a foggy forest. Character 1 is balancing on the rail with a flashlight, while Character 2 looks at a map near the wooden sleepers.

Lighting/Mood: illuminated by the pale blue light of a full moon and the sharp yellow beam of the flashlight cutting through the mist

NOTE: The aspect ratio of the image must be 2:3 (portrait, like a playing card or trading card format - 63mm x 88mm proportions).
